# cjk-test

The Unicode Consortium minimized the number of codepoints given to CJK-characters (CJK = Chinese-Japanese-Korean, Chinese characters, kanji, etc). The following labels use the exact same Unicode codepoints but highlight subtle differences in how different languages render the character.

Use the two map labels to check which language is being displayed.
